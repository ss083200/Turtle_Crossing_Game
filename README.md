# Turtle_Crossing_Game
Turtle Crossing Game is a Python project where players control a turtle to cross a road filled with cars. It incorporates OOP principles and modularity for better code organization and extensibility.

This project is a game developed using Python, where the player controls a turtle and tries to cross a road filled with moving cars. The goal is to safely reach the other side of the road without colliding with any cars. As the game progresses, the speed of the cars increases, providing a greater challenge for the player.

Features:

The game utilizes the turtle module for graphics and animation.
The player's turtle is controlled using the arrow keys to move up and down.
Cars are randomly generated and move from right to left across the screen.
Collision detection is implemented to detect if the player collides with any cars.
The game keeps track of the player's level and displays it on the scoreboard.
The level increases whenever the player successfully crosses the road.
The game ends when the player collides with a car, displaying a "GAME OVER" message.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Modularity:

The project demonstrates the use of OOP principles by creating classes for different entities in the game.
The Player class represents the player's turtle and handles its movement and position.
The CarManager class manages the generation and movement of cars.
The Scoreboard class handles the scoring and level display functionality.
By separating the code into classes, the project achieves modularity, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
Please note that this project requires the turtle module to run successfully.
